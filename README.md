# IoT_net_monitor
IoT adaptive system for remote monitoring using grafana, bash, database influxDB, python

Designed for the IoT systems course in UniTn (prof. Davide Brunelli, Alessandro Torrisi)

[Reliable Transiently-Powered Communication published by IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9733918)

Debug tool used for testing the TRAP (TRAnsiently-powered Protocol) for intermittent communication among transiently-powered devices. 

This technology needs a monitoring application which is able to track and store the messages of an IoT network. This report will explain how the tool concept was tested and upgraded in order to achieve the goal, reach the highest possible level of scalability and make the TRAP test procedure much more user-friendly. 

The software is capable to adapt to different IoT networks with just few inputs from the user.
